Later:
  - Task breaks ('holidays') (this will bring us to 1.0.0, though semver will be harder since the primary (currently only) interface is not an API)
  - Clean up archived_tasks code and general task code, it's messy
  - Support specifying config file to allow tests config to be split out into its own one?
  - General code cleanup
  - Task deletion
  - Weekly tasks
  - Show hit/miss rate for time periods on task (not just the last week)
  - Metrics on completed tasks
  - Make it look better
  - Upgrade bootstrap+others
  - Plan test+upgrade schedule for requirements (including bootstrap, etc)
  - Check for secure redirection: http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/62/
  - Make task completion page nicer
  - Tests, including ensuring no external calls (no, we are not using an externally hosted bootstrap- the code from this site will ALL come from this site not some random third party), limited numbers of calls on pages, limited DB calls on pages.
  - API? (versioned, separate version to app as a whole?)
  - For goals created under top level, output is ugly. Fix that.
  - Should it be possible to mark a day on an archived task as completed? Perhaps, but maybe by toggling that capability?
  - Create travis account, make this be tested
