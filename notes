Later:
  - Task end dates - added to DB. Needs to result in it being eternally 'done' and not showing last week of tasks. Task history needs to go from finish date rather than current date. This should probably happen on an 'archive' page with the default (currently home) being an 'active tasks' page
  - Add start and end dates of tasks on archived_tasks page
  - Clean up archived_tasks code and general task code, it's messy
  - General code cleanup
  - Task deletion
  - Weekly tasks
  - Show hit/miss rate for time periods on task (not just the last week)
  - Metrics on completed tasks
  - Make it look better
  - Upgrade bootstrap+others
  - Plan test+upgrade schedule for requirements (including bootstrap, etc)
  - Check for secure redirection: http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/62/
  - Make task completion page nicer
  - Tests, including ensuring no external calls, limited numbers of calls on pages, limited DB calls on pages.
  - API?
  - For goals created under top level, output is ugly. Fix that.
