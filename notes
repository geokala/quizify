Later:
  - Get tests in for all current aspects of code to ensure UI does not lose backwards compatibility (this should be clearly documented somewhere, but current plan is that anything that can currently be set should still be able to be set or it will be considered a breaking change)
  - Make a better config reader (use update on defaults)
  - Clean up archived_tasks code and general task code, it's messy
  - Support specifying config file to allow tests config to be split out into its own one?
  - General code cleanup
  - Task deletion
  - Weekly tasks
  - Show hit/miss rate for time periods on task (not just the last week)
  - Metrics on completed tasks
  - Make it look better
  - Upgrade bootstrap+others
  - Plan test+upgrade schedule for requirements (including bootstrap, etc)
  - Check for secure redirection: http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/62/
  - Make task completion page nicer
  - Tests, including ensuring no external calls (no, we are not using an externally hosted bootstrap- the code from this site will ALL come from this site not some random third party), limited numbers of calls on pages, limited DB calls on pages.
  - API? (versioned, separate version to app as a whole?)
  - For goals created under top level, output is ugly. Fix that.
  - Should it be possible to mark a day on an archived task as completed? Perhaps, but maybe by toggling that capability?
  - Create travis account, make this be tested
